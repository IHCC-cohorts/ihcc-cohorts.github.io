## About these pages

In the following you will find instructions on how to register a data dictionary with the IHCC data harmonization effort and map it to our *Genomics Cohorts Knowledge Ontology (GECKO)*. More information about the IHCC in general can be found at https://ihccglobal.org/.

The IHCC data harmonization effort facilitates the integration of cohort data under a common terminology, the *Genomics Cohorts Knowledge Ontology (GECKO)*. You can find our more about GECKO [here](http://www.obofoundry.org/ontology/gecko.html).

There are three major roles in the IHCC data harmonization effort:
* The *data dictionary maintainer* is the individual or group responsible for a particular data dictionary, such as the Genomics England (GE) data dictionary or the Golestan Cohort Study (GCS) data dictionary.
* The *IHCC data steward* is the point person (for the data dictionary maintainers) on the IHCC side, and responsible for guiding the *data dictionary maintainer* through the process of mapping a data dictionary to GECKO.
* The *IHCC DevOps engineer* is the responsible for the maintenance and deployment of our terminology services, namely:
   * The IHCC ontology lookup service: https://registry.ihccglobal.app/index
   * The IHCC mapping service: https://mapping.ihccglobal.app/zooma/
   * The IHCC mapping browser: https://mapping.ihccglobal.app/search

- If you want to raise an issue with the mapping process and you are familiar with GitHub, you can create a ticket on the [IHCC data harmonization tracker](https://github.com/IHCC-cohorts/data-harmonization/issues). Otherwise you can always send an email to ihcc-browser@googlegroups.com.
